This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

On the top of CRA, it adds:
 - sass & (S)CSS modules
 - redux & redux-thunk
 - react-router
 - prettier & eslint
 - Storybook

 The filesystem structure follows the [redux ducks proposal](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
